I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Amirkabir University. Throughout my studies, I've developed a keen interest in graph theory, algorithm design, and machine learning. I am fascinated by the intricacies of graph structures and their applications in solving complex problems. I also work as a softawre engineer in the Routing team at Snapp, a leading company in the taxi services industry with over 30 million users.
