- **B.S. Computer Science**\
Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)\
GPA: 3.94/4 

### Research Interests 
- Geometric Deep Learning 
- Knowledge Graphs 
- Theoretical Computer Science 
### Research Exprience 
- AGM -- Sep 2023 - present 

I've recently started working on Machine Learning on Graphs in AGM lab at Amirkabir University of Technology. 
So far, I've read many influential papers in this domain and have developed technical skills by implementing 
well-known GNN architectures such as GCN, GraphSage, and GAT in PyTorch Geometries. My main goal is to improve 
MRR score on ogbl-biokg dataset in Open Graph Benchmark.

### Work Experience 
- Snapp -- Feb 2023 - Present 

Snapp is a leading company in the taxi services industry with over 30 million users. I work as
a software engineer and am a member of the Routing team in Snapp’s map vertical. Here’s
some of the things I’ve done so far

  - Re-implemented ETA benchmarking service, making it about x10 times more performant
  - Worked collaboratively with other team members to improve the accuracy of the estimated time of arrival (ETA)
  - Read various research papers related to routing and navigation and gained a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms
  - Implemented a simple routing engine to understand different routing algorithms, such as contraction heirarchies and A* with landmarks
